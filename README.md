Welcome to my Data Science Internship Portfolio! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

I am delighted to share my experiences and accomplishments during the CODSOFT Data Science Internship, where I was privileged to explore three out of five diverse projects that spanned various aspects of data science. This internship has been a rich learning experience, and I am eager to present the outcomes of my diligent efforts. The following are the projects assigned by CODSOFT during this internship tenure:

<h3>Task 1:TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION</h3>
      
This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building a machine learning model to predict survival probabilities.This is a classic beginner project with readily available data. The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
      
<h3>Task 2:MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON</h3>
      
In this project, I built a movie rating prediction system using Python. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, and the development of a machine learning model to predict movie ratings.The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques.
      
<h3>Task 3:IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION</h3>
      
The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic machine learning task. It involves using the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.The objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species, This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

The CODSOFT Data Science Internship has been a transformative experience, equipping me with the technical expertise and domain knowledge to address complex, real-world data challenges.I appreciate the opportunity to have contributed to impactful projects and am excited to leverage these skills in future pursuits.

To delve deeper into each project, I invite you to connect with me on LinkedIn and explore my GitHub repositories. I extend my sincere gratitude to CODSOFT for this invaluable learning experience."
